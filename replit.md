# Smart Grid Energy Analytics Platform

## Overview

This is a comprehensive Smart Grid Energy Analytics Platform built with Streamlit that provides real-time monitoring, predictive analytics, and pattern analysis for energy consumption data. The platform simulates smart meter data and offers multiple machine learning-based analysis capabilities including demand forecasting, anomaly detection, and consumption pattern analysis. It features an interactive dashboard with visualizations for energy flow, consumption patterns, and operational recommendations.

## User Preferences
